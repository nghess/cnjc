[] how do source 1 and 2 work?

Each element of s and o
took either a 1 (ON) or a 0 (OFF) state. The left stimuli group
(o1, . . . ,o16) in Fig. 1a (left) took the value of source 1 with a 75% probability
or the value of source 2 with a 25% probability. In contrast, the
right group (o17, . . . ,o32) took the value of source 1 or 2 with a 25% or
75% probability, respectively. Analogous to the cocktail party
effect27,28, this setup is formally homologous to the task of distinguishing
the voices of speakers 1 (s1) and 2 (s2)
