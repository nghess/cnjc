Deep CANALs Notes:

Page 10: Does de-canalization necessarily disrupt all belief hierarchies equally? Do certain types of beliefs reside in more or less affected regions, either because of 5HT2AR density or by anatomical connectivity?

*The article is useful because in order to protect these drugs for those who need them, we need to understand what the misapplication looks like.

what is the mechanism that disrupts high-level generative models' prediction of lower levels (and inability to supress those beliefs)
	> is this related to faulty signal transmission, or to a greater than average prediction error
	> a higher entropy brain would mean one with more free energy, and free energy could be understood in terms of prediction error residuals?

does a high canalized hierarchy model cease to produce meaningful prediction errors, or simply cease to interpret them?



how many levels in the hierarchy might be conciously accessible?
	> my sense is that high level (but subordinate) models reach the level of concious percxeption as feelings but not thoughts.
	> but how articulate are these models, and are there beliefs that are articulate, but always below the level of concious articulation?
	> how might that fit into theories around entity contact in breakthrough trips?

does looking at psychopathology through an abstract lense make any sense in disorders where there may be genet

Arthur:
What does minimizing free energy in an RNN look like?
Can you walk me through figure 2?
do the inference and learning phases relate to the trip and the aftermath?
